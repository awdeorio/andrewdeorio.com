<h2>Interdisciplinary</h2>
<b>Creative Process</b> (UARTS 250)<br>
This is a class where students are encouraged, in an interdisciplinary way, to explore their own creativity. Faculty with training in Architecture, Visual Arts, Music and Engineering will teach students their own approaches to creativity within their fields, and encourage students to find their own approaches (in and out of their current stated disciplines). Students will be expected and encouraged to explore creativity without thinking about disciplinary boundaries. Students will have short 2-week "workshops" with each faculty member, as well as work on a Final Project, either on their own, or in an interdisciplinary team of their own creation.<br>
