Data abstraction helps computer scientists model complex phenomena and makes programs easier to maintain and modify.  This interactive lesson will focus on computer science concepts that apply to many different programming languages, although examples will be in C++.  The material is based on my lectures from a 200-level programming and introductory data structures class.
