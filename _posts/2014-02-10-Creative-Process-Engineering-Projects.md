Check out some of the engineering mini-projects from Creative Process (UARTS 250).  Students used the [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) programming language and [Makey Makeys](http://makeymakey.com/) to solve a problem of their choice.

The problem: learning braille.  This braille learning tool reads letters aloud as you move your finger across them.  Doug Nordman.

The problem: painting and music are separate art forms.  Enter musical water colors, where your canvas is connected to an electronic piano.  The piano sounds tones as you paint.  Mix colors to sound chords!  Kari Simonsen.
