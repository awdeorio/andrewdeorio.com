\"Malware on Drugs: Detecting Misbehaving Drug-delivering Medical Devices\"
at the [A2Y.asm Computer Security Conference](http://www.arbsec.org/a2y.asm/index.html)

Infusion pumps are computerized medical devices that deliver drugs directly to a patient\'s blood stream.  These devices are uniquely vulnerable to software compromise, yet difficult to protect with traditional anti-virus software.  In this talk, we will present our results detecting infusion pump misbehavior.  Our technique monitors device power consumption, builds a model of correct behavior, and detects anomalies using machine learning.  Visibility into a machine\'s behavior is the cornerstone of an effective anti-malware strategy, and we will show examples of how our technique can reliably detect undesired behavior with very low false-positive rates.
