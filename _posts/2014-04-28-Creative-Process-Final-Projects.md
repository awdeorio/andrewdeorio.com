Final projects are in from the Creative Process course.  Creative Process is a class where students are encouraged to explore their own creativity. Faculty from Architecture, Visual Arts, Music and Engineering teach students their own approaches to creativity.  Students engage in 2-week workshops with each faculty member, and then complete a final project.

You might also like some of the [projects from engineering workshop](/blog/2014/02/10/Creative-Process-Engineering-Projects) portion of the course, or take a look at the [syllabus](/teaching/assets/UARTS250_W15_Syllabus.pdf).
