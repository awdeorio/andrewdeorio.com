This year\'s [42 Hours of Re-Creativity](http://artsengine.umich.edu/42hrs.php) was focused on wearables, and had a great showing of teams.  Students from two groups used computing in their projects, both integrating computing using a [Makey-makey](http://makeymakey.com/) into their wearable projects.

Paul Giessner, Mihir Sheth, Angela Brazil, Tony Renwand, and Haolu Zhang made a suit that responded to real-life scenarios.  Using sensors in the knees, seat, elbows, pockets, and arms, the suit guides the wearer through a situation.  For example, during a job interview, it monitors body language and provides reminders like \"uncross your arms to keep your body language open.\"

Zach Boulanger, AnneMarie Mueller, and Katelyn Hoag worked to solve three problems: E-waste, homelessness and elderly care.  Using old electronics which would have been shipped overseas for an ecologically messy disposal, they made a wearable shelter.  The shelter\'s roof converted into an electronic chair and floor, which was then be used to sense when a person fell and could not get up.
