This semester\'s Creative Process is off to a great start!  Creative Process is a class where students are encouraged, in an interdisciplinary way, to explore their own creativity. ([UARTS 250 at Michigan](/teaching/assets/UARTS250_W15_Syllabus.pdf))  Check out some of the engineering mini-projects where students used [Makey Makeys](http://makeymakey.com/) to solve a problem of their choice.

*The music of vegetables.*  What happens when you connect vegetables to a computer?  Music!  A turntable moves a pair of beets, which connect a circuit to two carrots, laying down the beat for the music.  Next a cucumber is connected via an analog input, and custom software turns the vegetable into a tone generator.  \"It\'s vegan and has a turntable.  Definitely hipster!\"  Jessica Abfalter and Peter Littlejohn.

*Automated guitar tabulature.*  A MakeyMakey connects to a guitar, watching your fingers connect circuits between the strings and the frets.  Custom software creates tabulature (a type of guitar sheet music) from your playing.  Charley Kowalec.

*Water usage monitor*.  This internet-of-things inspired system measures your water usage, compares it against past usage, and sends a text message either with encouragement or a reminder, \"too much!\".  Shean Krolicki.
