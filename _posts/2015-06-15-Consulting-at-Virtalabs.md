I\'ll be spending the summer working with [Virtalabs](http://www.virtalabs.com/), software and hardware that analyzes equipment power consumption for anomalies and signs of malware.

From Virtalabs:
PowerGuard is a pass-through plug that constantly analyzes your equipment\'s power consumption for anomalies and signs of malware. It works literally outside the box and integrates with SIEMs to give you new visibility into embedded and fixed-purpose computers that are traditionally hard to monitor.  PowerGuard spots costly problems or breaches quickly to protect your assets-with zero software installation or hardware changes.
