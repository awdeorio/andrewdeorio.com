Pay a visit to the creative world of computer science and engineering with Dr. Andrew DeOrio.  In this hands-on session, you will be creative makers and problem solvers, engineering a solution to a problem.  We will use computing devices called [Makey-makeys](http://makeymakey.com/) to interface a computer to the real world.  By the end of the session, you will have a working demo and an experience with the creative side of engineering.  Please bring a laptop.

What people are saying about this workshop:

*We\'ve had some complaints regarding the noise level from faculty members . . . a protracted series of simultaneous cat meows . . . as I understand it these were electronic cats.*

This is the first time I\'ve had a noise complaint for teaching computer programming!
