An Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) is a language that hardware and software use to communicate.  This introductory, interactive lesson will cover ISA basics, instructions, assembly, and the power of abstraction.  The material is based on my lectures from a sophomore/junior level Introduction to Computer Organization course.
