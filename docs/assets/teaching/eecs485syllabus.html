      <h1>EECS 485: Web Systems Syllabus</h1>
      <p><i>The University of Michigan, Fall 2021</i></p>
      <p>A holistic course of modern web systems and technologies, covering front end and back end.  Build an Instagram clone in the first half of the semester and a Google clone in the second.</p>

      <p>We are planning for as much in-person instruction as we can safely provide, in line with <a href="https://campusblueprint.umich.edu/" target="_blank">University</a> and <a href="https://covid-19.engin.umich.edu/" target="_blank">College of Engineering</a> guidelines (<a href="https://campusblueprint.umich.edu/faqs/" target="_blank">FAQ</a>).  In exceptional cases, you may complete EECS 485 100% remotely with an approved <a href="https://ecas.engin.umich.edu/petitions/" target="_blank">CoE petition</a>.</p>

      <p><b>Lectures</b> will be mostly live and in-person.  One of Prof. DeOrio's sections will be asynchronous, with short videos released each week.  Prof. DeOrio will host Lecture Q&A sessions to discuss the videos. You may attend any lecture section or watch any of the recordings, even if it's different than your registered section. We don't take attendance in lecture.  If COVID guidelines preclude large in-person lectures, we will convert in-person lectures to live Zoom lectures at the same day and time.</p>

      <p><b>Projects</b> will be completed in groups and turned in to an autograder.  You can find a group using the "Search For Teammates" post on Piazza. If you'd like, we'll help you find a group.</p>

      <p><b>Labs</b> will be live and in-person with materials posted online.  Expect hands-on practice with concepts from lecture and project introduction material.  We don't take attendance in lab.</p>

      <p><b>Exams</b> will be <a href="./#schedule">scheduled</a> and timed.  We plan on in-person exams.</p>

      <p><b>Office hours</b> will be offered in-person as well as remote, both one-on-one and in groups.</p>

      <p>There will be one midterm and one final examination.  Exam dates are posted on <a href="./#schedule" target="_blank">eecs485.org</a>.  There will be no make-up exams.  It is your responsibility to verify you can attend both exams.</p>

      <h2 id="labs">Labs <a href="#labs"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a></h2>
      <p>Labs will contain hands-on practice with concepts from lecture and helpful project introduction material.</p>

      <h2 id="projects">Projects <a href="#projects"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a></h2>
      <p>This course contains 5 programming projects.  The first three focus on web apps, while the last two focus on web distributed systems and web semantics.</p>
      <p>Project 1: Templated Static Site Generator.  An Instagram clone implemented with a templated static site generator.</p>
      <p>Project 2: Server-side Dynamic Pages.  An Instagram clone implemented with server-side dynamic pages.</p>
      <p>Project 3: Client-side Dynamic Pages.  An Instagram clone implemented with client-side dynamic pages.</p>
      <p>Project 4: MapReduce.  A single machine, multi-process, multi-threaded server that executes user-submitted MapReduce jobs.</p>
      <p>Project 5: Search Engine.  A scalable search engine similar to Google or Bing.</p>

      <h3 id="project-groups">Project Groups <a href="#project-groups"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a></h3>
      <p>Project 1 is independent.  The remaining projects are completed in groups of 2-3.</p>
      <p>You may modify group membership between projects. You must not modify group membership during a project. In exceptional cases, you may request group dissolution via email to the faculty. If the dissolution is granted, all group members may use previously shared code and no group member may join another group for remainder of the project.</p>
      <p>Each group turns in one solution to the autograder. You must register your group on the autograder. All group members earn the same grade on a project.  We may adjust the grades of students who substantially under-participate based on feedback from their group members.</p>
      <p>For those retaking the course: if you submitted an assignment in a previous term, you must not work in a group on that same assignment this term.</p>

      <h3 id="project-grading">Project Grading <a href="#project-grading"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a></h3>
      <p>We use a web-based autograder to evaluate correctness and style.</p>
      <p>Before the deadline, you may submit up to 3 times per day. After each submission, the autograder shows the results of the public tests released with the project.</p>
      <p>After the deadline, the autograder shows the results of private tests.</p>
      <p>Your final project score is a combination of public and private tests.  We use the submission that received the combined best score. If multiple submissions share the best score, we grade the last.</p>

      <h2 id="grades">Grades <a href="#grades"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a></h2>
      <p>Letter grades are assigned on a curve.  In general, our goal is be consistent with <a href="https://atlas.ai.umich.edu/course/EECS%20485/" target="_blank">past semesters</a>.</p>

      <p>We calculate your total weighted score using these weights.</p>

      <h3 id="curve">Curve <a href="#curve"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a></h3>
      <p>Sometimes the difficulty of exams varies from semester to semester.  We use a curve to maintain consistent letter grades despite exam variation.  In general, our goal is be consistent with <a href="https://atlas.ai.umich.edu/course/EECS%20485/" target="_blank">past semesters</a>, where a median grade is 3.3 (B+).</p>

      <h3 id="minimum-scores">Minimum scores <a href="#minimum-scores"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a></h3>
      <p>You are guaranteed to pass EECS 485 with a C or better if your total weighted project score is at least 73.0%, and your total weighted exam score is within 1.5 standard deviations of the mean.</p>

      <p>We encourage collaboration in EECS 485, especially on concepts, tool, specifications, and strategies.</p>
      <p>All work you submit must be your own or your group's.  Collaboration must not result in code that is identifiably similar to other solutions, past or present.</p>

      <p>You are still responsible for following these rules even after finishing the course.</p>
      <p>If you are unsure about what constitutes an honor code violation, please contact the course staff with questions.</p>

      <h3 id="code-reuse">Code reuse <a href="#code-reuse"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a></h3>
      <p>If you are retaking the course, you may reuse your own code, provided it was wholly written according to rules outlined in this syllabus. It is possible for instructors to miss an honor code violation in a previous term, but catch and report it when the code is reused.</p>

      <h3 id="code-publishing">Code publishing <a href="#code-publishing"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a></h3>
      <p>You may not make your code publicly available in any form, for example, in a public GitHub repository or personal website.  You are still responsible for following these rules even after finishing the course.</p>
      <p>If you are recruiting and would like to show companies your work in EECS 485, our recommendation is to create a Git repository with only a README file and no code.  Take a screenshots of your solution put those in the README.  Include a description of the languages, libraries, frameworks, and technologies you used.  Another option is to privately demo or send your code to a recruiter.</p>
