      <h3 id="project-partnerships">Project Partnerships <a href="#project-partnerships"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a></h3>
      <p>Project 1 is independent.  You may work either alone or in a partnership for the remaining projects.</p>

      <p>If you work in a partnership, you must partner with a student registered for EECS 280 this term (any section).  You must not partner with anyone outside the course.  <mark>For those retaking the course: if you submitted an assignment in a previous term, you must not partner on that same assignment this term.</mark>
      <p>You may change partners between projects.  You must not change partners during a project.  In exceptional cases, you may request partnership dissolution via email to the faculty. If the dissolution is granted, both partners may use previously shared code and both partners must work alone on the remainder of the project.</p>
      <p>You and your partner turn in the same solution to the autograder.  You must register your partnership on the autograder.</p>

      <h3 id="project-grading">Project Grading <a href="#project-grading"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a></h3>
      <p>We use a web-based autograder to evaluate correctness, style, and the thoroughness of your tests.</p>
      <p>Before the deadline, you may submit up to 3 times per day. After each submission, the autograder shows the results of the public tests released with the project.</p>
      <p>After the deadline, the autograder shows the results of private tests, which are usually more thorough than the public tests.</p>
      <p>Your final project score is a combination of public and private tests.  We use the submission that received the combined best score. If multiple submissions share the best score, we grade the last.</p>

      <h3 id="programming-environment">Programming Environment <a href="#programming-environment"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a></h3>
      <p>You are free to develop on any platform.  You are responsible for any differences between your preferred platform and the grading platform, so use only ANSI/ISO standard C++. We recommend testing your code on <a href="http://caen.engin.umich.edu/accounts/obtain" target="_blank">CAEN Linux</a>, which provides version 4.8.5 of the g++ compiler, the same version used by the autograder.</p>

      <h3 id="project-tips">Project Tips <a href="#project-tips"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a></h3>
      <p>Tips for doing well on the projects include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Start early.</b>  This is the most common problem.</li>
        <li><b>Try a debugger.</b>  One major goal of this course is for you to learn to test and debug your programs independently.</li>
        <li><b>Ask for help.</b>  We want to help you in office hours!</li>
        <li><b>Back up.</b>  We can't help you with lost data.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Tips for project partnerships include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Form your partnership early.</b> Don't partner with someone who has already written most of the code, or vice versa. You won't get as much out of the project.</li>
        <li><b>Plan your strategy.</b> When will you meet? Do you plan to attend office hours? Do you prefer to work during the day, at night, or on the weekends? Will you start early?</li>
        <li><b>Work on all parts of the project together.</b> We strongly encourage <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming" target="_blank">pair programming</a>. It's also valuable practice for exams.</li>
        <li><b>Do NOT split the work in half</b> and work separately. You'll have no control over your partner's contribution. Splitting the work also harms your readiness for exams.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="grades">Grades <a href="#grades"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a></h2>
      <p>Letter grades are assigned on a straight scale with curved exams.  In general, our goal is be consistent with <a href="https://atlas.ai.umich.edu/course/EECS%20280/" target="_blank">past semesters</a>.</p>
      <p>Compared to previous semesters (before Winter 2021), exams are weighted less.  Additionally, letter grades are assigned on a straight scale and exams are curved individually.  The new process is intended to increase transparency, and we expect the overall grade distribution to remain consistent with past semesters.</p>
      
      <p>We calculate your total weighted score using these weights.</p>
      <table class="ui celled table">
        <thead>

        </tfoot>
      </table>

      <p>After computing the total weighted score, we use these ranges to assign letter grades.  Each range is half-inclusive, for example a score of 89.9% is a B+ and a score of 90.0% is an A-.  We may adjust thresholds in your favor.

      <p>You are still responsible for following these rules even after finishing the course.</p>
      <p>If you are unsure about what constitutes an honor code violation, please contact the course staff with questions.</p>

      <h3 id="code-reuse">Code reuse <a href="#code-reuse"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a></h3>
      <p>If you are retaking the course, you may reuse your own code, provided it was wholly written according to rules outlined in this syllabus. It is possible for instructors to miss an honor code violation in a previous term, but catch and report it when the code is reused.</p>

      <h3 id="code-publishing">Code publishing <a href="#code-publishing"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a></h3>
      <p>You may not make your code publicly available in any form, for example in a public GitHub repository or personal website.  You are still responsible for following these rules even after finishing the course.</p>

      <h3 id="honor-council-process">Honor Council Process <a href="#honor-council-process"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a></h3>
      <p>We report suspected violations to the Engineering Honor Council. To identify violations, we use both manual inspection and automated software to compare present solutions with each other, with past solutions, and with code found online. The Honor Council determines whether a violation of academic standards has occurred, as well as any sanctions. Read the <a href="https://ecas.engin.umich.edu/honor-council/" target="_blank">Honor Code</a> for detailed definitions of cheating, plagiarism, and other forms of academic misconduct.</p>
      <p>Here's what you can expect if you are reported for an honor council violation:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The EECS 280 instructors submit an official report to the honor council.</li>
        <li>The honor council notifies you of the report, and explains the next steps of the process.  You receive a copy of the report, including the evidence of the suspected violation.</li>
        <li>The course instructors play no role in adjudicating reported cases.</li>
        <li>The honor council notifies course instructors when your case is resolved. Any penalties they prescribe are applied to your grade. If you are found not responsible, your grade is unaffected.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you have a pending honor council case at the end of the term, you receive an "I" (incomplete) grade until the case is resolved.  We will send you a grade projection via email to help with planning.  Your grade is updated once the case is resolved. The "I" should not remain on your transcript.</p>

      <h2 id="accommodations">Accommodations for Students with Disabilities <a href="#accommodations"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a></h2>
      <p>If you think you need an accommodation for a disability, please let your instructor know during the first three weeks of the semester.  Some aspects of this course may be modified to facilitate your participation and progress. As soon as you make us aware of your needs, we can work with the Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) office to help us determine appropriate academic accommodations. SSD (734-763-3000; <a href="https://ssd.umich.edu" target="_blank">https://ssd.umich.edu</a>) typically recommends accommodations through a Verified Individualized Services and Accommodations (VISA) form. Any information you provide is private and confidential and will be treated as such.</p>

      <h2 id="recordings">Recordings <a href="#recordings"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a></h2>
      <p>Course lectures may be audio/video recorded and made available to other students in this course. As part of your participation in this course, you may be recorded. If you do not wish to be recorded, please contact your <a href="#instructors">instructor</a> the first week of class to discuss alternative arrangements.</p>
      <p>Students may not record or distribute any class activity without written permission from the instructor, except as necessary as part of approved accommodations for students with disabilities. Any approved recordings may only be used for the student’s own private use.</p>

      <h2 id="commitment-to-equal-opportunity">Commitment to Equal Opportunity <a href="#commitment-to-equal-opportunity"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a></h2>
